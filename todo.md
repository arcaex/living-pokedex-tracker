    * Clear all button (with confirm)

    * Mr mime has incomplete name an Magby is missing
    * Show a stats total: It would be nice if it had the number of poke caught and missing, it's always good to know
    * One suggestion I have is maybe adding two more filter options, correct ability(to keep track of HA) and correct Moves/egg moves?
    * Some gripes I have: When I go to tap a pokemon to say that I have it, the hitbox for the checkbox is too small and I end up going into the pokemons menu. Another one is that when you view a pokemon, it says something like: How to get: Evolve Dartrix to Level 34.  Level up would work better in place of evolve. Maybe something like what Serebii has where it lists: Sun   How to obtain   Evolves at level 34.  Good app overall though.
